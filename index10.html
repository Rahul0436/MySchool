        <h3>Be Glad Your Nose Is on Your Face</h3>

        <p>Be glad your nose is on your face,</p>
        <p>not pasted on some other place,</p>
        <p>for if it were where it is not,</p>
        <p>you might dislike your nose a lot.</p>
        <p>Imagine if your precious nose</p>
        <p>were sandwiched in between your toes,</p>
        <p>that clearly would not be a treat,</p>
        <p>for youâ€™d be forced to smell your feet.</p>
